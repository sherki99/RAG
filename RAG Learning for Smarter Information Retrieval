## Project Title: **RAG Learning for Smarter Information Retrieval**

### Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** system, designed to overcome the limitations of traditional keyword-based search by leveraging vector embeddings. RAG enhances the search experience by understanding the context and meaning of queries, ensuring more accurate and relevant results.

### Why Use a RAG System?
Traditional search techniques rely on text matching, which can miss important context and relationships in the data. For example:
- A query for "CEO" might overlook information that uses synonyms or related terms like "executive" or specific names such as "Lancaster" or "Avery."
- These limitations hinder the effectiveness of knowledge retrieval in complex domains like insurance, where precise and nuanced information is essential.

**Solution:** A RAG system solves this problem by combining:
1. **Vector Embeddings:** Captures the semantic meaning of text for smarter query results.
2. **Generative Models:** Produces natural language answers from the retrieved data.

### Key Features
- **Vector-Based Search:** Uses OpenAI embeddings to store and query document chunks.
- **Enhanced Contextual Understanding:** Retrieves information based on meaning rather than exact matches.
- **Interactive Visualization:** 2D and 3D representations of embeddings for better understanding and debugging.
- **Low-Cost Design:** Optimized for affordability with lightweight models.

### Project Contents
1. **Document Loader:** Prepares the knowledge base by splitting documents into smaller chunks.
2. **Vector Database:** Stores embeddings in a Chroma vector database for efficient querying.
3. **Visualization:** Illustrates how embeddings cluster semantically similar content.
4. **Query Example:** Demonstrates the advantage of vector search over text-based methods with a real-world use case:
    - Query: "CEO"
    - Result: Includes synonyms, references, and contextually relevant data that text search misses.

### How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
2. Set up your `.env` file with necessary API keys.
3. Run the notebook (`day3.ipynb`) and follow the steps to load documents, create embeddings, and query the system.

### Example Use Case
In the final notebook cell, the RAG system highlights the advantage of vector embeddings:
```python
for chunk in chunks:
    if 'CEO' in chunk.page_content:
        print(chunk)
        print("_________")
```
This showcases how vector search captures semantic meaning, retrieving more relevant information than traditional methods.

### Future Work
- Implement open-source alternatives for enterprise-grade security.
- Expand to more complex question-answering workflows.
